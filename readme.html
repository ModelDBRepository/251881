PLOS Computational Biology 2019

Usage:
Either auto-launch from ModelDB or download and extract the
archive and compile the mod files (with mknrndll (mswin and mac, or
nrnivmodl (linux/unix)).
Start the simulation by typing in a terminal window "nrngui mosinit.hoc" (linux/unix).

After selecting one of the buttons, the simulation will reproduce the somatic
membrane potential generated by applying different patterns of current stimuli
in the tonic and burst firing modes.

Examples:
clicking on "cNAD_ltb burst" will produce the following graph:

clicking on "cNAD_ltb tonic" will produce the following graph:

The ion channel densities were constrained through evolutionary multiobjective optimization
(BluePyOpt library).
The code used for the optimization, along with channel densities for the other acceptable models
are available under the <a href="https://github.com/BlueBrain/BluePyOpt/tree/master/examples/thalamo-cortical-cell">thalamocortical cell example</a>.


The experimental data to constrain the models were provided
by Jane Yi, Ying Shi, <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/markram-lab/">Laboratory of Neural Microcircuitry (LNMC)</a>.
